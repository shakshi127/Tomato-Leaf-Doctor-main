# Tomato Leaf Doctor 🌱  
AI-Powered Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

## What the Project Does
Tomato Leaf Doctor is a web-based application that uses Artificial Intelligence to detect diseases in tomato leaves.  
By uploading an image of a tomato leaf, the system classifies it into one of the following categories:
- Healthy
- Early Blight
- Late Blight

The prediction is generated instantly using a machine learning model trained with Google Teachable Machine and executed directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js.

## Why the Project Is Useful
Tomato leaf diseases can cause significant crop loss if not identified early.  
Manual inspection requires expert knowledge and can be time-consuming and costly.

This project is useful because:
- It enables **early detection** of tomato leaf diseases
- It provides **quick diagnosis** without need for agricultural experts
- It is **easy to use** and works on any device with a browser
- It can help in taking **timely preventive action**

## How to Get Started

### Live Demo (MVP)
https://shakshi127.github.io/Tomato-Leaf-Doctor-main/

### Steps to Use the Application
1. Open the live demo link in a browser
2. Upload an image of a tomato leaf (JPG or PNG format)
3. Wait for the AI model to analyze the image
4. View the predicted disease class and confidence score

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project folder in VS Code
3. Use the **Live Server** extension to open `index.html`
4. Upload a tomato leaf image to test the model

## Technologies Used
- Google Teachable Machine (Model Training)
- TensorFlow.js (Browser-based Model Execution)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Google Chrome (Testing & Deployment)

## Limitations
- The model currently supports only tomato leaves.
- Only three classes are detected: Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight.
- Prediction accuracy depends on image quality and lighting conditions.
- Internet connectivity is required to load the AI model.

## Where to Get Help
If you face issues or have suggestions:
- Open an issue in this GitHub repository
- Refer to Google Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js documentation
